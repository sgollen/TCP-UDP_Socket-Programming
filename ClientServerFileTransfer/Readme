INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING:
- The program can be compiled by executing "make" command.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING:
- Please run the nEmulator1 first using ./emulator <receiver's port number> <sender's receiving port number>.
- Next run the sender with appropriate arguments.
- Lastly run the receiver with appropriate arguments.
- server never exits until manually terminated using Ctrl C.
- The project is created and tested on University of Waterloo Student Environment: linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca

EMULATOR
Number of parameters: 2
Parameter:
    $1: <receiver's port number>
    $2: <sender's receiving port number>
To run the emulator execute:  ./nEmulator1 $1 $2


SENDER
Number of parameters: 4
Parameter:
    $1: <host address of the receiver>
    $2: <udp port used by the emulator for data>
    $3: <udp port used by the sender for acks>
    $4: <name of the file to be transmitted>
To run the sender execute:  java sender $1 $2 $3 $4

RECEIVER
Number of parameters: 4
Parameter:
    $1: <hostname for the network emulator>
    $2: <UDP port number used by the emulator for acks>
    $3: <UDP port number used to receive data>
